simplecov-simple-html
=====================

Generates a nice, but simple HTML report of your SimpleCov ruby code coverage results on Ruby 1.9.

The main difference is that the HTML generated by +simplecov-simple-html+ will display without javascript being enabled.

If javescript is enabled then the search/filter and column sorting features will work.

Each group tab and source file is represented by a separate HTML file.  Which can be useful for some use cases.
